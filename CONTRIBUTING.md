## First: Where to Ask Questions

Before submitting issues or pull requests, please use the **Structr Forum** for

- Ensure the issue describes a reproducible bug

When reporting a bug, include:
- Structr version
- Deployment setup
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected and actual behavior
- Relevant logs or error messages (if available)

contributions are welcome.
