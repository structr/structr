To get access to Structr's backend, you need to login first. The backend access URL has the following form:

    http://<hostname>:<port>/structr/#login

The path part after the "#" is related to the main menu section in Structr, see <a href="#Main User Interface">Main User Interface</a> below.
    
This page shows a login dialog with username and password.

The initial credentials are admin/admin. If you entered invalid credentials, i.e. a wrong combination of username and password, you get the following error message:

<img src="/Structr Login(3).png_thumb_300x169?2" class="zoomable">

<p class="warning">Please make sure to change your password directly after login.</p>            

To change your password, you can either go to the Users and Groups view, or the Data view or use the REST interface.

To logout, click on the logout button in the header. This will terminate the login session in the current browser instance.
