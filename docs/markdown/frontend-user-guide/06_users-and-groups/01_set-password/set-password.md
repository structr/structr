To set the password of a user, navigate to the Users and Groups view and hover over the user you want to change the password for.

Click on the properties icon (<img src="properties.png" style="display:inline;vertical-align:middle">).

In the Edit Properties dialog, activate the Node Properties tab, scroll to the line with the Password key and enter the new password into the value field.

Please Note: While you're typing, you can see the new password you're entering. The existing password will never be displayed. Structr does not store cleartext passwords but only a hash value. The hash value also is never being displayed in the UI.
