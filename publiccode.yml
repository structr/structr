    genericName: "Low-code development and runtime platform"
    shortDescription: >
      Generic open source low-code development and runtime platform based on graph
      technology for building fully custom applications.
    longDescription: >
      Structr is a generic low-code development and runtime platform built on a graph
      database. It is not tied to any specific domain or predefined use case and
      provides full flexibility and extensibility to create custom applications within
      its scope (web apps, graph-backed backends, middleware/integration components).

      Graph database foundation:
      Structr uses a graph database to store both (a) application components (schema,
      types, UI building blocks, templates, scripts, flows) and (b) the default
      application/user data. This provides schema flexibility, fast graph traversals,
      and high performance for complex domains.

      Dual UI model (developer/admin vs end-user):
      Structr provides a web-based Developer/Admin UI (Structr IDE) with no-code,
      low-code and pro-code tools to modify the “application graph” (the part of the
      database that defines the application). Developers typically do not edit a raw
      application source tree; they edit schemas, isolated script expressions/methods,
      HTML templates, and virtual files stored in the graph. Using these tools,
      developers create the end-user facing web UI.

      JSON Schema interoperability:
      The database schema can be represented as JSON Schema (json-schema.org) and
      supports import/export.

      Polyglot development:
      Structr supports multiple programming languages via GraalVM: application logic
      and dynamic content can be implemented using any language supported by GraalVM.

      Files & content:
      Structr provides an internal virtual filesystem for managing images, videos and
      binary content with custom metadata. Binary data can be stored externally using
      file storage providers; S3 repositories are supported. Structr also supports
      “dynamic files”: virtual files whose content is generated in real time via
      scripts that evaluate graph data and may integrate external data sources or
      user input. Files can be accessed through supported protocols (e.g. HTTP, FTP,
      SSH/SCP) depending on deployment/configuration.

      Integration & protocols (selected):
      - APIs: REST/JSON
      - Messaging / pub-sub: AMQP (e.g. RabbitMQ), Kafka, Pulsar, XMPP
      - Mail: SMTP (outbound), IMAP
      - File access / storage: HTTP, S3, FTP, SSH/SCP
      - Optional integrations: OAuth providers (SSO), LDAP-compatible services

      AI & automation:
      Structr can be used with AI to create apps and to interact with Structr
      applications and managed data through MCP.

      Support & websites:
      Community site, forum and documentation are available at https://structr.org.
      Commercial offerings (including commercial support and custom development) are
      available from Structr GmbH at https://structr.com.

      Licensing:
      Structr is dual-licensed: open source (GPLv3/AGPLv3) and commercial/individual
      licensing options.

      Data protection & hosting:
      Structr GmbH is based in Germany (EU). Deployments can be aligned with GDPR
      requirements depending on configuration and operational context; standard
      hosting on German/EU-based providers is available.
