## Overview

**Structr** is an open source **generic low-code development and runtime platform** built on graph
technology. It is **not limited to any predefined use case** and supports the creation of
**fully custom applications** — including web applications, graph-database-backed backends,
data-centric systems, middleware, and integration components. Structr provides both a developer
IDE and an end-user application runtime UI.  [oai_citation:1‡GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/structr/structr/refs/heads/main/README.md)

All application components and data are stored in a **graph database**, providing flexible
schema evolution, fast graph traversals, and powerful modeling without join constraints.  [oai_citation:2‡GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/structr/structr/refs/heads/main/README.md)

Structr can represent its database schema as **JSON Schema** and supports both import and export.

Structr also provides an internal **virtual filesystem** with metadata and optional external
storage support (e.g., S3), as well as access via common protocols (HTTP, FTP, SSH/SCP).

## What Structr is not

To set expectations, Structr is **not**:
- A prebuilt business application (CMS, CRM, ERP)
- A fixed template or domain-specific framework
- A simple website builder
- A replacement for general-purpose programming languages

It is a **generic application platform** where you design and operate your app at a high level
using structured tools.

---

## Frontends and Development Model

### Structr Developer / Admin UI (IDE)

The web-based “Structr IDE” exposes schema, data, workflows, scripts, UIs, and operational tools.
Developers edit high-level artifacts (schemas, templates, scripts, virtual files) stored in the
graph rather than a traditional source tree.

### End-User Application UI

Using the Admin tools, you define the pages, bindings, layouts, and logic that form the
**end-user application UI**, which Structr serves directly.
