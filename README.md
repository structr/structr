# The Structr Project

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/structr/structr.png)](http://travis-ci.org/structr/structr)

Structr (pronounce it like 'structure') is a Java framework for mobile and web applications based on the graph database Neo4j. It was designed to simplify the creation of complex graph database applications by providing a comprehensive Java API and a set of features common to most use cases. This enables developers to build a sophisticated web or mobile app based on Neo4j within hours.

Structr was awarded with the Graphie Award (by Neo4j maker Neo Technology) for the Most Innovative Open Source Graph Application in 2012.


## Quick Start

Build and run Structr from the source code.

Prerequisites are the Java JDK 1.7, Maven 3.0.4+ and git.

## Getting Started
Using [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) archetypes, you get a demo project up and running in 5 minutes.

- See the [screencast](http://vimeo.com/53235075) for a short introduction to the maven archetype and a small feature demo.
- See the [structr-android-client](https://github.com/structr/structr-android-client) project on github for more information on how to use structr as a mobile backend.


## Components

To get an overview of the components, just browse the source code and review the README's.
