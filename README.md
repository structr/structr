# The Structr Project

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/structr/structr.png)](http://travis-ci.org/structr/structr)

Structr (pronounce it like 'structure') is a Java framework for mobile and web applications based on the graph database Neo4j. It was designed to simplify the creation of complex graph database applications by providing a comprehensive Java API and a set of features common to most use cases. This enables developers to build a sophisticated web or mobile app based on Neo4j within hours.

### Main components
- Object-to-Graph mapper (OGM)
- REST server
- CMS frontend

For detailed feature lists of these components see

[OGM](http://docs.structr.org/dev-guide#Object-to-graph mapping)

[Backend Features](http://docs.structr.org/rest-user-guide)

[Frontend Features](http://docs.structr.org/frontend-user-guide)

### Awards
Structr was awarded with the Graphie Award for the Most Innovative Open Source Graph Application in 2012.

## Getting started
Structr uses [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), so you can use Maven to get a demo project up and running in 5 minutes with our simple example archetype.

- See the [screencast](http://vimeo.com/53235075) for a short introduction to the maven archetype and a small feature demo.
- See the [structr quick start guide](http://structr.org/quick-start-guide) for more information on the CMS module.
- See the [structr-android-client](https://github.com/structr/structr-android-client) project on github for more information on how to use structr as a mobile backend.

## Examples

### A simple “city” entity in Java..

	public class City extends AbstractNode {

		// define a 1:n relationship between “City” and “Person”
		public static final Property<List<Person>> persons =

			new CollectionProperty<Person>(
				"persons",               // the name of the property
				Person.class,            // the end node type
				RelType.LIVES_IN,        // the relationship type
				Direction.INCOMING,      // the direction
				true                     // 1:n instead of n:m
			);
	
		// define the public view of a City to contain name and persons
		public static final View publicView = new View(Person.class, PropertyView.Public,
			name, persons
		);
	}


### .. its creation via REST using the demo server
	curl -si http://0.0.0.0:8082/structr/rest/cities -XPOST -d '{"name":"Berlin"}'

	HTTP/1.1 201 Created

## Components

There are these two main components: Structr Server and Structr UI.

Structr Server provides libraries and modules building the backend.

Structr UI is a frontend for CRUD operations and basic CMS functionalitiy, e.g. for handling pages, files, images, users/groups.
