# What is Structr?

Structr is an integrated low-code development and runtime environment that uses a graph database. With Structr, you can build enterprise web applications many times faster than with traditional development methods and run them directly on the Structr server in the same environment.

Structr provides low-code capabilities that allow users without extensive development skills to create simple applications, while experienced developers can create sophisticated, state-of-the-art enterprise solutions with 100% flexibility in all areas.

This unique combination of low-code and pro-code capabilities makes Structr an exceptionally useful and productive tool for application development, and its graph technology makes it the perfect platform for all connected data use cases.
