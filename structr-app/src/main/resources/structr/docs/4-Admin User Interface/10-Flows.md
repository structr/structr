### Process Automation

- Event-driven workflow triggers
- Scheduled and recurring processes
- Conditional logic and branching
- Parallel execution and synchronization

### Integration Capabilities

- External API integration
- Database operations
- File processing and transformation
- Email and notification services


## Next Steps

After mastering the Flows section:

1. Integrate flows with your [Schema](3-Schema.md) types for data processing
2. Trigger flows from [Pages](5-Pages.md) for user-initiated processes
3. Use flows to automate [Data](4-Data.md) management tasks
4. Monitor flow performance through the [Dashboard](2-Dashboard.md)

The Flows section enables powerful automation capabilities that can significantly improve efficiency and consistency in your Structr applications. Well-designed flows reduce manual work, eliminate errors, and enable your applications to respond intelligently to events and changes.
