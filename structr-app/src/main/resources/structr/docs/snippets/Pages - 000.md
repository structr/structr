A Structr page is a tree-like structure of nested HTML elements, stored in the graph database. The representation in the database corresponds exactly to the structure of the HTML output. In the rendering process, a page behaves like a declarative “program” that combines context information, access control and script expressions to create a dynamic HTML document.
