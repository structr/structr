# Settings description
"Settings" has description "The following table lists all configuration settings available in Structr. You can view and modify these settings in the Configuration Interface, which opens in a separate browser tab when you click the wrench icon in the Admin UI header bar. The Configuration Interface requires authentication with the superuser password from `structr.conf`. Alternatively, you can edit the `structr.conf` file directly and restart the server."
